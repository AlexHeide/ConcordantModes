# MixedHessian
This will be a method that is an automation of several scripts, which allow the user to compute an approximate high cardinality basis hessian from a mostly lower cardinality basis hessian. So, one could compute frequencies at a CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ level of theory, then compute the diagonal, internal coordinate force constants at a CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of theory, to get a very good approximation to CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ frequencies.
